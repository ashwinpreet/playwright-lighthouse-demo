# Slow Load Demo (React)

This project demonstrates a slow-loading React page for performance testing. It simulates a slow initial load and includes several large images to further delay rendering.

## Features
- Artificial delay before main content appears
- Several large/slow-loading images

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Performance Testing
You can use Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, or any other tool to measure the page load performance.

**Tip:** For best results, throttle network speed in DevTools to simulate slow connections.
